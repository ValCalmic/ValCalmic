- 📫 How to reach me: valcalmic@gmail.com

I am a highly skilled professional in the fields of Marketing and Retail Development with decades of experience. I view cybersecurity as a professional challenge that offers great employment opportunities in a high demand limited supply type of labor market. I am passionate about protecting innocent victims against attacks and breaches and I ardently wish to acquire the necessary skills to be a sort of an online law-enforcement officer fighting criminals, fraudsters and the internet underworld.
